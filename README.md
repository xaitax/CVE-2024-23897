## üìÜ Changelog

### [29th Febuary 2024] - Bugs & Feature Request (thanks to [@cbartholomew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophermbartholomew/))

- The packet length will now adjust to ensure all file names will be uploaded with the correct packet lengths. i.e. works with more than just /etc/passwd or 11 character file lenghts.
- Added `-c COMMAND` which allows the testing of other jenkins-cli.jar commands: who-am-i,connect-node. Default remains "help".
- Added `-l LANGUAGE` which allows for the 5 byte language code, i.e. en_US, cn_ZH, etc. The default is en_US.

### [27th January 2024] - Feature Request

- Added scanning/exploiting via input file with hosts (`-i INPUT_FILE`). 
- Added export to file (`-o OUTPUT_FILE`).

### [26th January 2024] - Initial Release

- Initial release.
